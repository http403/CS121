More complicated?

How about math?
sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.0
How about with floats?

Sorting Hat? What's that?
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
Slytherin

With all of these, what's my pay?
If I worked 25 hours with $7.5/hr and I will get $187.50/week
ALLERT: OVERTIME
But I actually worked 50 hours with $0/hr. So my pay is $0.00. Sad

No pay isn't a problem. Give me a grade.
My Grade is F.
You must be kidding me. My grade should be DISQUALIFIED. No cheating.
